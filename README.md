This app is a simplified version of a ML for analyzing neuron spikes in an Axion MEA system. 

A spinal cord injury (SCI) typically results from a physical blow that fractures or dislocates the disks of bone that make up the spine, disrupting sensory signals between the brain and the body. SCI degrees of seriousness and treatment options vary. In the U.S. alone, more than 17,000 people suffer an SCI each year. After a spinal cord injury, a personâ€™s sensory, motor and reflex messages may be diminished or completely disabled below the site of damage. In general, the higher in the spinal cord the injury occurs, the more dysfunction the person will experience. Spinal cord injuries are defined as complete or incomplete depending on how much movement and sensation remains.
